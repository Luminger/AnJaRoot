 - The hook targets setcap() because we are using LD_PRELOAD for our business
   and LD_PRELOAD can only overwrite external library symbols for obvious
   reasons. This leads to the problem that a function we want to hook needs to
   be resolved at runtime and we can't use any inlined function. In my tests
   setresuid() and friends are all inlined, so bad luck here. A hookable
   function must a) be resolved by libdvm.so (you may verify that with the
   strings/objdump tool on your system) and b) needs to be run by the Zygote
   BEFORE setcap() has run (see vm/native/dalvik_system_Zygote.cpp, method
   forkAndSpecializeCommon()).
